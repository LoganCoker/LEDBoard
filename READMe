Code for the LED board

libraries: 
    rpi_ws281x 
    argparse 
both of these libraries are for working with the LED strip. 

For the expo, we used the file 'Testing.py' as our GUI. 

'Functions.py' is two function taken from the internet to make a rounded square

'testy.py' is half a test file form the internet and half things we made ourself.
    Everything pre-made is marked above in a comment
